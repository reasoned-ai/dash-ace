# Create a production build and publish:

1. Build your code:
    ```
    $ npm run build
    ```
2. Create a Python tarball

    ```
    $ python setup.py sdist
    ```

    This distribution tarball will get generated in the `dist/` folder

3. Test your tarball by copying it into a new environment and installing it locally:

    ```
    $ pip install dash_ace_persistent-0.0.1.tar.gz
    ```

4. If it works, then you can publish the component to NPM and PyPI:

    1. Publish on PyPI
        ```
        $ twine upload dist/*
        ```
    2. Cleanup the dist folder (optional)
        ```
        $ rm -rf dist
        ```
    3. Publish on NPM (Optional if chosen False in `publish_on_npm`)
        ```
        $ npm publish
        ```
        _Publishing your component to NPM will make the JavaScript bundles available on the unpkg CDN. By default, Dash serves the component library's CSS and JS locally, but if you choose to publish the package to NPM you can set `serve_locally` to `False` and you may see faster load times._

5. Share your component with the community! https://community.plot.ly/c/dash
    1. Publish this repository to GitHub
    2. Tag your GitHub repository with the plotly-dash tag so that it appears here: https://github.com/topics/plotly-dash
    3. Create a post in the Dash community forum: https://community.plot.ly/c/dash
